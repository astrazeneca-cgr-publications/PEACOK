# PEACOK
Phenome Exome Association and Correlation Of Key phenotypes

This R package  re-implements, customizes and enhances the phenome scan functionlities of the original PHESANT R programs as described in https://github.com/MRCIEU/PHESANT. In this implementation, while trying to make it compatiable with the original approach, we focus on seperating phenotype matrix generation from statistical association tests and allowing statistical tests to be performed seperately on different computing envrionments, such as a high perforance comuting cluster or an AWS Batch envrionment. 

Users are encouraged to check out the PHESANT R program first to understand the design and functionalities there. The companion R documentation PEACOK.pdf in this folder provides further details on functions implemented in the package.  We are also in the process of adding more examples to show how to use these functions.
